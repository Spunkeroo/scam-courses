Here's how to keep it safe:\n\n1. **Never share your seed phrase** — No legitimate service, exchange, or support team will ever ask for your seed phrase. Period. If someone asks for it, it's a scam.\n\n2. **Use a hardware wallet** — For any significant holdings, use a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor. These keep your private keys offline and safe from hackers.\n\n3. **Enable 2FA everywhere** — Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy), NOT SMS-based 2FA which can be SIM-swapped.\n\n4. **Bookmark your exchanges** — Never click links from emails or DMs. Always type the URL or use bookmarks.\n\n5. **Use a dedicated browser** — Keep a separate browser with no extensions for crypto activity."

Is it verified on Etherscan?\n\n3. **Liquidity check** — Is liquidity locked? For how long? Use tools like DexTools or DexScreener.\n\n4. **Community analysis** — Is the community organic or full of bots? Check Twitter followers for engagement ratio.\n\n5. **Token Sniffer** — Run the token through Token Sniffer or RugDoc for automated red flag detection."

If it doesn't match the expected domain, don't click.\n\n3. **Look for urgency** — 'Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!' is a classic pressure tactic.\n\n4. **Check for personalization** — Legitimate companies use your name.

Outside perspective helps.\n\n5. **Report it** — Report the profile to the dating app or social media platform, and to the FTC."

Your money goes to pay earlier investors.\n\n3. **Recruitment pressure** — They push you to bring in friends and family, because they need new money to pay you.\n\n4. **Difficulty withdrawing** — When you try to take profits, there are delays, fees, or minimum hold periods.\n\n5. **Famous examples** — Bernie Madoff ($65B), BitConnect ($2.6B), OneCoin ($4B+)."

Usually 99% of participants lose money.\n\n4. **Pay to play** — Paying to join or paying monthly fees for the right to sell.\n\n5. **Complex compensation plans** — If you need a degree in math to understand how you get paid, that's by design."
